# Building with Musl

These are scripts for building applications with [Musl](http://musl.libc.org/) support.
They use the [Unikraft-ported `lib-musl`](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) together with [ongoing PRs](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl/pulls).

The top-level scripts (with the `do-` prefix) are the wrapper scripts to setup, build and run Unikraft applications (built with Musl support).
They include common-part scripts in the `../include/` directory.

Applications, libraries and Unikraft are set up and built in the `../workdir/` directory.

## app-helloworld

Use the `do-helloworld` script to build and run [`app-helloworld`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld) with Unikraft and [Musl](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) as its libc.
Note that Musl is not actually used, since the internal [`nolibc` library](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/nolibc) has all required features;
it is however built and integrated into the final image.
[lwip](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-lwip) is also included in the build, although, again, is not really required;
you can disable the inclusion of `lwip` by switchin the `USE_LWIP` variable in the `do-helloworld` script to value `0`.

Pass required commands to script:

1. First, set up repositories:

   ```
   $ ./do-helloworld setup
   ```

   This results in creating the `../workdir/` folder with the local conventional file hierarchy:

   ```
   $ tree -L 2 ../workdir/
   workdir/
   |-- apps
   |   `-- app-helloworld
   |-- archs
   |-- libs
   |   |-- lwip
   |   `-- musl
   |-- plats
   `-- unikraft
   [...]
   ```

1. Build the hellworld Unikraft image:

   ```
   $ ./do-helloworld build

   [...]
   Successfully built unikernels:

     => build/helloworld-x86_64
     => build/helloworld_kvm-x86_64.dbg (with symbols)

   To instantiate, use: kraft run
   ```

1. Run the hellworld Unikraft image:

   ```
   $ ./do-helloworld run

   [...]

   Hello, world!
   ```

   The image prints the `Hello, world!` message.

## app-helloworld-cpp

Use the `do-helloworld-cpp` script to build and run [`app-helloworld-cpp`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld-cpp) with Unikraft and [Musl](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) as its libc.
Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `helloworld-cpp` throughout commands to use.
This includes the possible exclusion of the `lwip` library from the build by toggling the value of the `USE_LWIP` variable in the `do-helloworld-cpp` script.

## app-httpreply

Use the `do-httpreply` script to build and run [`app-httpreply`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-httpreply) with Unikraft and [Musl](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) as its libc.
Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `httpreply` throughout commands to use.

The `run` command creates a web server waiting for connections:

```
$ ./do-httpreply run

```

The server waits for connection on IP address `172.44.0.2` on port `8123`.
Test it by running `ping` and then `wget` on another console:

```
$ ping 172.44.0.2

The `index.html` page is provided by the server.
A confirmation message is also shown by the Unikraft server in its console:

```

## test

Use the `do-test` script to build and run the custom tests from [Dragoș's repository](https://github.com/dragosargint/test);
they test the clone system call and new thread support in Unikraft.

Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `test` throughout commands to use.

Using the `run` command prints out an extensive output (debugging is enable).
The relevant lines are red `ERR` lines.
As long as they mention `GOOD` in the message, everything is OK:

```
$ ./do-test run

```

## libc-test

Use the `do-libc-test` script to build and run tests in the [`libc-test` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-libc-test).
They test the interface of Musl (and, presumably, other standard C libraries).

Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `libc-test` throughout commands to use.

The `run` command triggers the execution of tests.

```
$ ./do-libc-test run
[...]

```

## libsodium

Use the `do-libsodium` script to build and run tests in the [`lib-libsodium` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-libsodium).
The script builds libsodium together with Musl.

Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `libsodium` throughout commands to use.

The `run` command triggers the execution of tests.

```
$ ./do-libc-test run
[...]

Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `redis` throughout commands to use.

The `run` command creates a Redis server waiting for connections:

The server waits for connection on IP address `172.44.0.2` on the default port (`6379`).
Test it by running `redis-cli` in another console:

```
$ redis-cli -h 172.44.0.2

## Nginx

Use the `do-httpreply` script to build and run [`app-nginx`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-nginx) with Unikraft and [Musl](https://github.com/unikraft/lib-musl) as its libc.
Follow the exact same steps as above, but replace `helloworld` with `nginx` throughout commands to use.

The `run` command aims to start an Nginx web server:

```
$ ./do-nginx run_qemu

                 Phoebe 0.10.0~0bbbd142
nginx: [emerg] sigaction(SIGHUP) failed (38: Unknown error)
```

Given the current lack of signal support, the command fails.
